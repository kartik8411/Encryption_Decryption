# Symmetric Encryption with Fernet

This is an example of symmetric encryption using the `cryptography` library's `Fernet` module. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of the message. The example demonstrates how to encrypt a message and then decrypt it using the same key.

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you'll need to have Python and the `cryptography` library installed.

### Install `cryptography` Library

If you haven't already installed the `cryptography` library, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
