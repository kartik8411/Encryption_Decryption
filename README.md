# *Symmetric Encryption with Fernet*

This is an example of symmetric encryption using the `cryptography` library's `Fernet` module. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption of the message. The example demonstrates how to encrypt a message and then decrypt it using the same key.

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you'll need to have Python and the `cryptography` library installed.

### Install `cryptography` Library

If you haven't already installed the `cryptography` library, you can install it via pip:

```
pip install cryptography
```
## How to Run
1. ### Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. ### Install the necessary dependencies with *pip install cryptography*.
3. ### Run the script:

```
python encrypt_decrypt.py
```
